# Descritization-Binning
Discretization and binning are techniques in data science used to convert continuous data into discrete intervals (bins). This simplifies analysis, improves model performance, and reduces noise. Common methods include equal-width binning (fixed range intervals) and equal-frequency binning (bins with similar data counts).
